# Pokejong

### React, Express, MongoDB

Pokejong - combination of mahjong game and pokemon theme. I created it from scratch to practice my MERN skills. Unlock and remove all tiles from the board. Register to save your scores to the database.

- flexible game logic which allows to render any 2d size grid with tile unlocking mechanism
- random set of pokemons from Pokeapi
- backend form validation
- JWT authentication
- MongoDB for users and scores storage
